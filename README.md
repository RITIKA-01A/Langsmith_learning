# LangSmith Learning & Experiments

This repository contains my hands-on exploration of **LangSmith** and its core features, with a focus on **observability, tracing, and debugging** LLM applications.

The goal of this project is to understand how LangSmith can be used to monitor, analyze, and improve different types of LLM-based workflows.

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

In this repo, I have explored LangSmith across multiple use cases, including:

### 🔹 LangSmith Basics
- Introduction to LangSmith
- Understanding traces, runs, and metadata
- Setting up LangSmith for local development

### 🔹 Observability in LangChain Applications
- Tracing **simple chains**
- Observing **sequential chains**
- Monitoring inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps
- Debugging chain execution using LangSmith UI

### 🔹 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Applications
- Tracing RAG pipelines
- Observing document retrieval and context injection
- Analyzing model responses based on retrieved context
- Debugging retrieval and generation steps using LangSmith

### 🔹 LangGraph Tracing
- Tracing applications built using **LangGraph**
- Observing node-level execution
- Understanding graph-based workflows and transitions
- Monitoring complex agent-style flows in LangSmith

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **LangSmith** – Observability & tracing
- **LangChain** – Chain and RAG implementations
- **LangGraph** – Graph-based LLM workflows
- **Python** – Core implementation language

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- Learn and understand LangSmith in depth  
- Explore observability for different LLM application patterns  
- Gain practical experience in tracing and debugging LLM workflows  
- Serve as a reference for building production-ready, observable LLM systems  

---

## 📚 Status
This repository is a **learning and experimentation project** and will be updated as I explore more advanced LangSmith features and use cases.

---

## 📬 Notes
This repo focuses on **understanding and experimentation**, not on building a single production application.

---

Feel free to explore the code and traces to understand how LangSmith integrates with different LLM workflows.
